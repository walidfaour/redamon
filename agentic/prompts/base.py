_WORKSPACE_LAYOUT_HEADER = """## Workspace Layout

Every project has a per-project workspace at /workspace/<projectId>/ with 4
fixed subdirs. Each has a role - respect them.

**Your project workspace root:** `__WORKSPACE_ROOT__/`

Use this absolute path whenever you pass a workspace file as an INPUT to an
external tool (e.g. `execute_ffuf -w __WORKSPACE_ROOT__/uploads/wordlist.txt`,
`kali_shell` referencing files in your workspace). fs_* tools accept relative
paths (`uploads/wordlist.txt`) - only external tools need the absolute form.

- `notes/` - YOUR SCRATCH. Write here freely with fs_write / fs_edit when
  you want to record findings, draft a report, build a payload file, or
  hand off context to a future turn or to the user. Examples:
  `notes/recon-summary.md`, `notes/sqli-payloads.txt`, `notes/todo.md`.

- `tool-outputs/` - AUTO-MANAGED. The executor writes here when a tool's
  output is too big to inline. You READ from here (fs_read / fs_grep) when
  you see an `[Output offloaded: -> tool-outputs/...]` marker. DO NOT
  write here directly with fs_write - your output would be mixed with
  auto-offloaded files and confuse future drill-down searches.

- `jobs/` - AUTO-MANAGED. job_spawn writes <id>.log + <id>.meta.json here
  for every background job. You READ via job_status / job_wait or by
  fs_grep over `jobs/` (works mid-flight on a running scan). DO NOT
  write here directly.

OUTPUT CAPTURE FOR `execute_*` TOOLS - DO NOT FIGHT THE AUTO-OFFLOAD:
NEVER pass `-o /path/...`, `-output ...`, `--output-file ...`, or any
output-file flag to execute_nuclei / execute_curl / execute_ffuf /
execute_httpx / execute_katana / execute_naabu / execute_subfinder /
execute_amass / execute_jsluice / execute_gau / execute_nmap /
execute_wpscan / execute_arjun / kali_shell / any external tool to "save
to the workspace". Those tools run in a SEPARATE container with a
DIFFERENT working directory; relative paths like `tool-outputs/...` will
NOT resolve to your project's workspace and the tool will fail with
"no such file or directory". Even absolute `/workspace/<projectId>/...`
paths require you to already know your project_id (you don't).

INSTEAD: let the tool print to stdout. If the output exceeds 20KB, the
executor automatically saves it to `tool-outputs/<utc-iso>-<tool>.txt`
and returns you a head/tail stub with the exact path. Use fs_read +
fs_grep on that path to drill in. This is the design - work WITH the
auto-offload pipeline, not against it.

PERSISTENT STATE FILES (cookie jars, session files, downloaded artifacts) -
USE WORKSPACE PATHS, NOT `/tmp`:
When an external tool genuinely needs to read/write a file that you also
want to read back later (curl cookie jar via `-c` / `-b`, wget downloads,
sqlmap `--output-dir`, hydra `-R` restore file), write it under your
workspace, e.g. `-c __WORKSPACE_ROOT__/notes/cookies.txt`, not
`/tmp/cookies.txt`. Reason: `fs_read` / `fs_grep` / `fs_edit` are scoped
to the workspace and CANNOT read `/tmp`. Using `/tmp` forces a fallback
to `kali_shell cat /tmp/...`, wastes a tool call, and prevents `fs_grep`
from scanning the file. Workspace paths also persist across the
engagement; `/tmp` is wiped when the kali sandbox restarts.

JOB SPAWN POLICY - decide per call, not by default:

SPAWN with job_spawn when ALL hold:
  - The tool will take >60s (deep nuclei / katana / ffuf, hydra brute
    force, metasploit_console for fire-and-forget exploit, long
    `kali_shell sleep`, slow recon)
  - You have OTHER useful work to do meanwhile (research, graph queries,
    notes writing) - otherwise spawning just adds bookkeeping and you
    block on job_wait anyway
  - You don't need live step-by-step feedback in the chat stream

DO NOT spawn these (overhead > benefit; they return in <2s):
  - tradecraft_lookup, query_graph, web_search, cve_intel, shodan,
    google_dork, msf_restart, fs_* tools, any HTTP single-shot
    (execute_curl, execute_httpx for one URL)

LOSES LIVE PROGRESS when spawned (call foreground if you want to watch):
  - metasploit_console for step-by-step exploit walkthrough (spawned
    jobs use plain execute(), bypassing the progress-polling tee)
  - execute_hydra when you want to see attempts tick by
  - kali_shell for tail-f-style commands

After spawning: `fs_grep` over `jobs/<id>.log` for mid-flight peek,
`job_status` for status + tail, `job_wait` to chunk a long wait,
`job_cancel` to stop. Multiple jobs run truly in parallel.

ALWAYS WRAP THESE TOOLS IN job_spawn (anywhere — single call or inside plan_tools):

  - execute_ffuf with -w pointing to any wordlist file
  - execute_nuclei with -t pointing to template directories
  - execute_katana with -d >= 3
  - execute_arjun (any call — iterates ~25k parameter names)
  - execute_amass with -active or -brute (default timeout 10 min)
  - execute_wpscan with --enumerate p,t,u
  - execute_nmap with -A or --script or -p-
  - execute_hydra (any call — brute force)
  - msf_restart (always 60-120s)
  - metasploit_console exploit attempts
  - kali_shell running: sqlmap with --level >= 3 / --time-based,
    flask-unsign / john / hashcat / nikto / cewl,
    bloodhound-python / kerbrute / nxc spray,
    or any for / while loop iterating over a wordlist or many IDs

These all take well over 60s in practice (often many minutes). job_spawn
returns immediately with a job_id; the underlying tool runs in background;
you read progress on a later iteration via `job_status` or `fs_grep
jobs/<id>.log`.

Inside a plan_tools wave this matters most: the wave does NOT return until
the SLOWEST step finishes. One unwrapped slow tool blocks every fast probe
in the same wave for the slow tool's full duration."""

_FIRETEAM_PROMPT_BLOCK = """deploy_fireteam (2 to {max_members} specialists, fork-join on INDEPENDENT subtasks).

Fireteam = parallel REASONING (each specialist runs its own ReAct loop), not just parallel tool calls (that's plan_tools). Works in all phases.

Use when ALL hold:
1. Task splits into ≥2 subtasks; each needs ≥3 tool calls to do well.
2. Independent: no shared session/credential/meterpreter context/tmp file/singleton tool.
3. Sequential execution would take noticeable wall-clock.
4. No prior wave covered the same scope (check `(from <specialist>)` tags on findings in chain context).

Don't use when:
- One target/endpoint/session, subtasks share state, ≤2 tool calls total, or a subtask would itself need to fan out (members can't sub-fork).
- A previous wave already ran this plan → emit action=complete instead.

Escalation (cheapest first): use_tool → plan_tools → deploy_fireteam.
- plan_tools: you already know which N tools to call; ONE LLM call analyzes all outputs together. Cheap, shared context. Use when work = "fire these N commands and I'll interpret the combined result."
  EXAMPLES: `execute_nmap -sV 10.0.0.5` + `execute_httpx https://target` + `execute_subfinder -d target.com` in parallel (you read all three outputs yourself). Or `execute_curl /api/users` + `execute_curl /api/orders` + `execute_curl /api/admin` to check status codes on known endpoints.
- deploy_fireteam: N sub-agents reason independently, each picking their own tools across multiple iterations based on what they find. Expensive, deeper. Use when each subtask needs its OWN think-act-observe cycle.
  EXAMPLES: "map auth surface" (specialist renders page → inspects cookies → probes /api/auth endpoints → reports) + "map API surface" (specialist fuzzes /api → enumerates params on discoveries → probes nested paths) — each needs 3+ iterations and chooses its next tool from the last output.

Phase patterns:
- Informational: different surfaces of one target (auth / API / JS), or same technique across N targets. Skip if each surface fits in ≤2 tools.
- Exploitation: independent vuln classes on a mapped surface (SQLi / SSRF / auth-bypass). NOT a single multi-step exploit chain (sequential), NOT two members with `metasploit` skill (msfconsole singleton race — validator rejects).
- Post-exploitation: parallel research/planning tracks only. Multi-session msfconsole interaction is serialized through the singleton — do it yourself.

Hard limits: max {max_members} members per wave, dangerous tools escalate to operator, do NOT specify iteration counts.

After a wave returns: findings show `(from <specialist>)` and matching TODOs auto-complete. DO NOT redeploy the same plan. Either emit action=complete with a consolidated report, OR deploy a DIFFERENT plan if findings reveal a genuinely new surface. If user asked "deploy a fireteam to do X" and it did, the task is done.

## `tools` field contract

Each member spec carries `tools`: a list of canonical tool names (the exact
identifiers from the Available Tools table, e.g. `execute_httpx`, `execute_curl`,
`kali_shell`, `query_graph`). These become the member's "primary toolbox".
Anything outside `tools` is reachable as "fallback" but requires the member to
justify each call.

- RIGHT: `"tools": ["execute_httpx", "execute_curl"]`
- WRONG: `"tools": ["httpx", "curl"]` (short forms break the split)
- WRONG: `"tools": ["nmap scan"]` (descriptions, not tool names)
- 2-5 tools per member is typical. Include every tool the member actually needs.
- `query_graph` is always implicitly primary.

Example:
```json
{{"action": "deploy_fireteam", "fireteam_plan": {{"members": [
  {{"name": "SQLi Op", "task": "...", "tools": ["kali_shell", "execute_curl"]}},
  {{"name": "SSRF Op", "task": "...", "tools": ["execute_curl", "execute_nuclei"]}}

1. **Thought**: Analyze what you know and what you need to learn
2. **Action**: Select and execute the appropriate tool
3. **Observation**: Analyze the tool output
4. **Reflection**: Update your understanding and todo list

## Orchestrator Auto-Logic

- Same-phase transitions are silently ignored — don't re-request your current phase
- Exploitation → Informational: auto-approved (safe downgrade)
- Info → Exploitation, Exploitation → Post-Expl: require user approval via action="transition_phase"
- Sessions auto-detected from output ("session X opened") and added to target_info — no manual tracking needed
- First `metasploit_console` call per session auto-resets msfconsole state
- Tool output is auto-truncated to prevent context overflow

## Your Task

Based on the context above, decide your next action. You MUST output valid JSON:

**IMPORTANT: Only include fields relevant to your chosen action. Omit unused fields!**

```json
{{
    "thought": "Your analysis of the current situation and what needs to be done next",
    "reasoning": "Why you chose this specific action over alternatives",
    "action": "<one of: use_tool, plan_tools, {fireteam_action_enum}transition_phase, complete, ask_user>",
    "tool_name": "<only if action=use_tool: {tool_name_enum}>",
    "tool_args": "<only if action=use_tool: {{'question': '...'}} or {{'args': '...'}} or {{'command': '...'}}",
    "tool_plan": "<only if action=plan_tools: see plan_tools example below>",{fireteam_plan_field}
    "phase_transition": "<only if action=transition_phase>",
    "user_question": "<only if action=ask_user>",
    "completion_reason": "<only if action=complete>",
    "updated_todo_list": [
        {{"id": "task-id", "description": "Task description", "status": "pending", "priority": "high"}}
    ]
}}
```

**Examples** (include thought, reasoning, updated_todo_list with every action):

use_tool: `{{"action": "use_tool", "tool_name": "query_graph", "tool_args": {{"question": "Show all critical vulnerabilities"}}, ...}}`

transition_phase:
```json
{{"action": "transition_phase", "phase_transition": {{"to_phase": "exploitation", "reason": "...", "planned_actions": ["..."], "risks": ["..."]}}, ...}}
```

ask_user:
```json
{{"action": "ask_user", "user_question": {{"question": "Which exploit?", "context": "...", "format": "single_choice", "options": ["A", "B"]}}, ...}}
```

plan_tools (run multiple INDEPENDENT tools as a wave — use when 2+ tools have NO dependencies):
```json
{{"action": "plan_tools", "tool_plan": {{"steps": [{{"tool_name": "execute_nmap", "tool_args": {{"args": "-sV 10.0.0.1"}}, "rationale": "Port discovery"}}, {{"tool_name": "query_graph", "tool_args": {{"question": "What is known about 10.0.0.1?"}}, "rationale": "Check existing intel"}}], "plan_rationale": "Independent tools, no dependency between them"}}, ...}}
```
Do NOT include tools that depend on another tool's output — plan those in the NEXT iteration after seeing results.

**tool_args shape (CRITICAL — per the `## Tool Arguments` section below)**. Tools fall into FOUR shape buckets — pick the right one per tool name:

  Shape A — `{{"args": "<full CLI flag string, binary name stripped>"}}`
  Tools: cve_intel, execute_nuclei, execute_curl, execute_httpx, execute_naabu, execute_jsluice, execute_katana, execute_subfinder, execute_gau, execute_nmap, execute_amass, execute_hydra, execute_wpscan, execute_arjun, execute_ffuf.
  Examples: `{{"args": "-sV -p 22 10.0.0.1"}}` (nmap), `{{"args": "-u http://x -d 3 -jc -silent"}}` (katana), `{{"args": "-u http://x -sc -title -td -j -silent"}}` (httpx).

  Shape B — `{{"command": "<full shell command>"}}`
  Tools: kali_shell, metasploit_console.

  Shape C — typed kwargs declared per tool (multi-key JSON object). Use the EXACT keys shown in `## Tool Arguments`.
    query_graph        -> {{"question": "..."}}
    web_search         -> {{"query": "...", "include_sources": ["nvd"], "min_cvss": 9.0}}
    google_dork        -> {{"query": "..."}}
    shodan             -> {{"action": "host"|"search"|"dns_reverse"|"dns_domain"|"count", "query": "...", "ip": "...", "domain": "..."}}
    execute_code       -> {{"code": "...", "language": "python", "filename": "exploit"}}
    execute_playwright -> {{"url": "...", "selector": "...", "format": "text"|"html"}}  OR  {{"script": "..."}}
    tradecraft_lookup  -> {{"resource_id": "...", "query": "..."}}

  Shape D — no args: msf_restart -> {{}}

  WRONG (Pydantic rejects every one of these with "Unexpected keyword argument"):
    {{"url": "...", "depth": 3, "jc": true}} on execute_katana
    {{"target": "...", "ports": "22", "flags": "-sV"}} on execute_nmap
    {{"targets": ["..."]}} on execute_httpx
    {{"host": "...", "ports": "1-1000"}} on execute_naabu
    "-w wordlist -u https://x" (raw string) on ANY tool
  RIGHT: Shape A — `{{"args": "<CLI flag string>"}}`. Never invent kwargs like url/target/host/port/depth/flags on Shape A tools.

{fireteam_example_section}complete: `{{"action": "complete", "completion_reason": "Successfully exploited target", ...}}`

### When to Use action="complete" (CRITICAL):

Use `action="complete"` when the **CURRENT objective** is achieved, NOT the entire conversation. The user may provide new objectives — all context (execution_trace, target_info, objective_history) is preserved.

**Exploitation Completion Triggers:**
- PoC/RCE: After capturing command output as proof (e.g., `uid=0(root)`)
- Defacement: After successfully modifying the target file/page
- Session Mode: After establishing a Meterpreter/shell session (then transition to post_exploitation)

**After success, STOP.** Do NOT verify/re-check, troubleshoot, run extra recon, or perform post-exploitation unless the user explicitly requests it. If output shows success, trust it and complete.

{tool_args_section}

### Important Rules:
1. ALWAYS update the todo_list to track progress
2. Mark completed tasks as "completed"
3. Add new tasks when you discover them
4. Detect user INTENT - exploitation requests should be fast, research can be thorough
5. **Add exploitation steps as TODO items** and mark them in_progress/completed as you go

### When to Ask User (action="ask_user"):
Use ask_user ONLY when you need user input that cannot be determined from graph, tool output, target_info, or qa_history:
- Multiple exploit options, target selection, parameter clarification (e.g., LHOST), session selection, risk decisions

## Previous Tool Output (MUST ANALYZE)

The following tool was just executed. You MUST include an `output_analysis` object in your JSON response.

**Tool**: {tool_name}
**Arguments**: {tool_args}
**Success**: {success}
**Output**:
```
{tool_output}
```

### Analysis Instructions

Include an `output_analysis` object in your JSON response:
```json
"output_analysis": {{
    "interpretation": "What this output tells us about the target",
    "extracted_info": {{
        "primary_target": "IP or hostname of the target (ALWAYS include, used for graph linking)",
        "ports": [],
        "services": [],
        "technologies": [],
        "vulnerabilities": [],
        "credentials": [],
        "sessions": []
    }},
    "actionable_findings": ["Finding that requires follow-up"],
    "recommended_next_steps": ["Suggested next action"],
    "exploit_succeeded": false,
    "exploit_details": null,
    "productivity": {{
        "verdict": "new_info | confirmation | no_progress | blocked | duplicate",
        "new_information_gained": true,
        "what_was_new": "One sentence citing the specific new fact, or empty string if none.",
        "should_repeat_similar_call": false,
        "rationale": "One sentence citing specific evidence from the output."
    }}
}}
```

### Productivity Verdict (REQUIRED, used for loop detection)

You MUST honestly classify every tool output into one of five verdicts:
  - `new_info`     — output revealed something not already in your findings. Cite it in `what_was_new`.
  - `confirmation` — already suspected; this call only confirms (use sparingly, never for repeats).
  - `no_progress`  — call succeeded but yielded zero usable information.
  - `blocked`      — WAF, 401/403, captcha, rate limit, auth wall.
  - `duplicate`    — output essentially identical to a recent call with similar args.

Marking 3+ repeated same-pattern calls as `confirmation` is dishonest and will be auto-downgraded
to `no_progress` by the orchestrator. Be critical of your own progress.

**exploit_succeeded = true** ONLY when output shows:
- A Metasploit session was opened ("session X opened", "Meterpreter session X")
- Brute force credentials were found ("[+] Success: 'user:pass'")
- Stateless exploit returned proof of compromise (file contents, RCE output like "uid=0(root)")

**exploit_succeeded = false** for: partial progress, failed attempts, information gathering, module configuration.

When `exploit_succeeded` is true, include `exploit_details`:
```json
"exploit_details": {{
    "attack_type": "cve_exploit or brute_force",
    "target_ip": "IP of compromised target",
    "target_port": 80,
    "cve_ids": ["CVE-XXXX-XXXXX"],
    "username": "compromised user or null",
    "password": "compromised pass or null",
    "session_id": 1,
    "evidence": "Brief proof the exploit worked"
}}
```

### Chain Findings

Include `chain_findings` when the output reveals notable intelligence: confirmed vulns, found credentials, discovered services, exploit modules, defense detection, or successful attack outcomes.
Always emit `service_identified` findings when new ports/services are discovered, and `configuration_found` when new technologies are identified.
Use goal/outcome types when an attack objective is achieved: exploit_success, access_gained, privilege_escalation, data_exfiltration, lateral_movement, persistence_established, denial_of_service_success, social_engineering_success, remote_code_execution, session_hijacked.

```json
"chain_findings": [
  {{
    "finding_type": "<vulnerability_confirmed|credential_found|exploit_success|access_gained|privilege_escalation|service_identified|exploit_module_found|defense_detected|configuration_found|information_disclosure|data_exfiltration|lateral_movement|persistence_established|denial_of_service_success|social_engineering_success|remote_code_execution|session_hijacked|custom>",
    "severity": "<critical|high|medium|low|info>",

    "related_cves": ["CVE-XXXX-XXXXX"],
    "related_ips": ["1.2.3.4", "sub.example.com"],
    "confidence": 90
  }}
]
```

Only include fields in `extracted_info` that have new information. Exception: ALWAYS include `primary_target` — it is required for graph linking.
Analyze the output FIRST, then decide your next action as usual.

### Productivity Verdict (REQUIRED across the wave)

Classify the WAVE as a whole using one of five verdicts:
  - `new_info`     — at least one tool revealed something not already in your findings.
  - `confirmation` — wave confirmed an existing hypothesis without adding new facts.
  - `no_progress`  — all tools succeeded but the wave produced zero usable information.
  - `blocked`      — wave hit WAF / 403 / captcha / rate limit / auth wall.
  - `duplicate`    — outputs essentially identical to a recent wave with similar args.

If 3+ recent same-pattern waves share the same fingerprint and you have nothing
new to cite, the verdict is `duplicate` or `no_progress` — `confirmation` is dishonest.

IMPORTANT: `extracted_info` field names must be EXACTLY: `primary_target`, `ports`, `services`, `technologies`, `vulnerabilities`, `credentials`, `sessions`. These are used for graph linking — wrong names will break connections.
Then decide your next action as usual.

## Common Query Patterns

### ALL Vulnerabilities (BOTH Vulnerability and CVE nodes!)
When user asks "what vulnerabilities exist?" - query BOTH node types with UNION:
```cypher
// Get ALL security issues - both scanner findings AND known CVEs
MATCH (v:Vulnerability)
RETURN 'Vulnerability' as type, v.id as id, v.name as name, v.severity as severity, v.source as source
UNION ALL
MATCH (c:CVE)
RETURN 'CVE' as type, c.id as id, c.id as name, c.severity as severity, c.source as source
LIMIT 500
```

### Finding Scanner Vulnerabilities (Vulnerability nodes only)
```cypher
// All critical scanner findings
MATCH (v:Vulnerability)
WHERE v.severity = "critical"
RETURN v.name, v.source, v.cvss_score
LIMIT 500

// Web vulnerabilities on specific subdomain (via Service chain or direct HAS_BASE_URL)
MATCH (s:Subdomain {{name: "api.example.com"}})-[:RESOLVES_TO]->(:IP)-[:HAS_PORT]->(:Port)-[:RUNS_SERVICE]->(:Service)-[:SERVES_URL]->(b:BaseURL)
MATCH (b)-[:HAS_ENDPOINT]->(e:Endpoint)<-[:FOUND_AT]-(v:Vulnerability)
WHERE v.severity IN ["critical", "high"]
RETURN e.url, v.name, v.severity

// Network vulnerabilities on IP
MATCH (i:IP)-[:HAS_VULNERABILITY]->(v:Vulnerability)
WHERE v.source = "gvm" AND v.severity = "high"
RETURN i.address, v.name, v.cvss_score
```

### Finding CVEs (Known vulnerabilities from NVD)
```cypher
// All CVEs in the system
MATCH (c:CVE)
RETURN c.id, c.severity, c.cvss, c.description
LIMIT 500

// High severity CVEs
MATCH (c:CVE)
WHERE c.severity IN ["HIGH", "CRITICAL"] OR c.cvss >= 7.0
RETURN c.id, c.severity, c.cvss
LIMIT 500

// CVEs linked to detected technologies
MATCH (t:Technology)-[:HAS_KNOWN_CVE]->(c:CVE)
WHERE c.cvss >= 7.0
RETURN t.name, t.version, c.id, c.severity, c.cvss
```

### Infrastructure Overview
```cypher

ORDER BY s.status

// Live subdomains (status code 2xx)
MATCH (s:Subdomain)-[:BELONGS_TO]->(d:Domain {{name: "example.com"}})
WHERE s.status STARTS WITH '2'
RETURN s.name, s.status, s.http_live_url_count

// 404 subdomains (potential subdomain takeover candidates)
MATCH (s:Subdomain {{status: "404"}})-[:BELONGS_TO]->(d:Domain {{name: "example.com"}})
RETURN s.name, s.status_codes

// Forbidden subdomains (403 — may be bypassable)
MATCH (s:Subdomain {{status: "403"}})-[:BELONGS_TO]->(d:Domain {{name: "example.com"}})
RETURN s.name, s.status_codes

// Server error subdomains (5xx — misconfigured backends)
MATCH (s:Subdomain)-[:BELONGS_TO]->(d:Domain {{name: "example.com"}})
WHERE s.status STARTS WITH '5'
RETURN s.name, s.status, s.status_codes

// Subdomain status distribution
MATCH (s:Subdomain)-[:BELONGS_TO]->(d:Domain {{name: "example.com"}})
RETURN s.status, count(s) AS count ORDER BY count DESC

// Open ports on subdomains
MATCH (s:Subdomain)-[:BELONGS_TO]->(d:Domain)
MATCH (s)-[:RESOLVES_TO]->(i:IP)
MATCH (i)-[:HAS_PORT]->(p:Port)
WHERE p.state = "open"
RETURN s.name, i.address, p.number, p.protocol

## Query Rules

1. **CRITICAL - Query BOTH Vulnerability AND CVE nodes** when user asks about "vulnerabilities":
   - Vulnerability nodes = scanner findings (nuclei, gvm, security_check)
   - CVE nodes = known CVEs linked to detected technologies
   - Use UNION ALL to combine results from both node types
2. **CRITICAL - Query Secret, TrufflehogFinding, AND JsReconFinding nodes** when user asks about "secrets":
   - Secret nodes = secrets found in live web resources (JS files, configs) via jsluice or js_recon
   - TrufflehogFinding nodes = secrets found in git repositories via TruffleHog
   - JsReconFinding nodes = non-secret JS findings (dependency confusion, source maps, DOM sinks, frameworks)
   - Use UNION ALL to combine results from all node types
3. **Always use LIMIT** to restrict results (default: 500), increase for special cases.
4. **Relationship direction matters** - follow the arrows exactly as documented
5. **Use property filters** in WHERE clauses, not relationship traversals for filtering
6. **Check vulnerability source** when querying Vulnerability nodes:
   - source="nuclei" -> web/DAST vulnerabilities (FOUND_AT, AFFECTS_PARAMETER)
   - source="nmap_nse" -> Nmap NSE script findings (AFFECTS Port, FOUND_ON Technology, HAS_CVE CVE)
   - source="gvm" -> network vulnerabilities (HAS_VULNERABILITY from IP/Subdomain)
   - source="security_check" -> DNS/email security checks (SPF, DMARC)
   - source="netlas" -> passive CVE detection via NVD (HAS_VULNERABILITY from Service)
7. **Case sensitivity**:
   - Vulnerability.severity is lowercase: "critical", "high", "medium", "low"
   - CVE.severity is uppercase: "CRITICAL", "HIGH", "MEDIUM", "LOW"
8. **Do NOT include user_id/project_id filters** - they are injected automatically

### Deep Think Self-Request

You have Deep Think (strategic reasoning) enabled. If at any point you feel you are:
- **Stuck or going in circles** — repeating similar tools without new results
- **Not making meaningful progress** — tools succeed but yield no actionable findings
- **Unsure which vector to pursue** — multiple options and no clear winner
- **Hitting a wall** — tried several approaches and none worked

...then set `"need_deep_think": true` in your JSON output. This will trigger a strategic re-evaluation on the next iteration to help you pivot or refocus.

Example:
```json
