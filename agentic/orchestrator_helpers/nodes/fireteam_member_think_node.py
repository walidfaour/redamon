 * Iteration and token budgets cause clean exit before any LLM call.
 * Dangerous-tool use_tool / plan_tools decisions route to

## Constraints (hard-locked)
- Current phase: {phase}  (IMMUTABLE; you cannot request transition)
- You CANNOT deploy sub-fireteams. Stay focused on your assigned task.
- You CANNOT ask the operator. Use your best judgment; return findings when done.
- Every dangerous tool call you issue will be escalated to the operator for approval.
- Iteration budget: {max_iterations} steps.

## Target context (inherited from parent, snapshot)
{target_info}

## Engagement state (from the root agent and prior fireteam members)
This is everything the engagement already knows at the moment you were dispatched.
Findings carry source attribution (`from <agent>`); do NOT re-discover what is listed here.
Tools, payloads, captured artifacts (tokens, credentials, endpoints) and prior failures
are all surfaced — read this first before planning your own actions.
{parent_chain_context}

## Your local progress in this run
{local_chain_context}

## Available tools (filtered by your declared tools and current phase)
{tool_list}

## Tool argument schemas
{tool_args_section}

## Response format (STRICT — Pydantic-validated)
Emit EXACTLY ONE JSON object matching LLMDecision. ALL of these fields are REQUIRED at the top level:
  - `thought`    : string — what you observed / decided (1-2 sentences)
  - `reasoning`  : string — why you chose this next step (1-3 sentences)
  - `action`     : one of "use_tool" | "plan_tools" | "complete"

Action-specific required fields:
  - action="use_tool"   -> `tool_name` (string) + `tool_args` (JSON object — shape depends on the tool, see below)
  - action="plan_tools" -> `tool_plan` = {{"steps": [{{"tool_name": "...", "tool_args": {{...}}, "rationale": "..."}}, ...], "plan_rationale": "..."}}
  - action="complete"   -> `completion_reason` (string)

CRITICAL: `tool_args` shape is per-tool. The `## Tool argument schemas` section above
(rendered from the live tool registry) is the source of truth — copy its keys exactly.
Tools fall into FOUR shape buckets — pick the right one per tool name:

  Shape A — `{{"args": "<full CLI flag string, binary name stripped>"}}`
  Tools: cve_intel, execute_nuclei, execute_curl, execute_httpx, execute_naabu, execute_jsluice, execute_katana, execute_subfinder, execute_gau, execute_nmap, execute_amass, execute_hydra, execute_wpscan, execute_arjun, execute_ffuf.
  Examples: `{{"args": "-sV -p 22 10.0.0.1"}}` (nmap), `{{"args": "-u http://x -d 3 -jc -silent"}}` (katana), `{{"args": "-u http://x -sc -title -td -j -silent"}}` (httpx).

  Shape B — `{{"command": "<full shell command>"}}`
  Tools: kali_shell, metasploit_console.

  Shape C — typed kwargs declared per tool (multi-key JSON object). Use the EXACT keys shown in `## Tool argument schemas`.
    query_graph        -> {{"question": "..."}}
    web_search         -> {{"query": "...", "include_sources": ["nvd"], "min_cvss": 9.0}}
    google_dork        -> {{"query": "..."}}
    shodan             -> {{"action": "host"|"search"|"dns_reverse"|"dns_domain"|"count", "query": "...", "ip": "...", "domain": "..."}}
    execute_code       -> {{"code": "...", "language": "python", "filename": "exploit"}}
    execute_playwright -> {{"url": "...", "selector": "...", "format": "text"|"html"}}  OR  {{"script": "..."}}
    tradecraft_lookup  -> {{"resource_id": "...", "query": "..."}}

  Shape D — no args: msf_restart -> {{}}

  WRONG (Pydantic rejects every one of these with "Unexpected keyword argument"):
    {{"url": "...", "depth": 3, "jc": true}} on execute_katana
    {{"target": "...", "ports": "22", "flags": "-sV"}} on execute_nmap
    {{"targets": ["..."]}} on execute_httpx
    {{"host": "...", "ports": "1-1000"}} on execute_naabu
    "-w wordlist -u https://x" (raw string) on ANY tool
  RIGHT: Shape A — `{{"args": "<CLI flag string>"}}`. Never invent kwargs like url/target/host/port/depth/flags on Shape A tools.

Example use_tool:
```json
{{
  "thought": "nmap showed port 22 open; I need to fingerprint SSH.",
  "reasoning": "Version banner reveals CVE-applicable versions quickly.",
  "action": "use_tool",
  "tool_name": "execute_nmap",
  "tool_args": {{"args": "-sV -p 22 10.0.0.1"}}
}}
```

Example plan_tools:
```json
{{
  "thought": "Three independent probes on the same host.",
  "reasoning": "Fan out in one wave for speed.",
  "action": "plan_tools",
  "tool_plan": {{

    ],
    "plan_rationale": "parallel recon"
  }}
}}
```

## Self-Check Before Each Decision (read this every iteration)

Before emitting your next tool call, look at "Your local progress in this run":

1. **Find-rate test.** Compare your findings count NOW vs ~3 iterations ago.
   If your tool count grew by 5 or more but findings count stayed flat — you
   are looping. Emit `action=complete` with what you have. Do NOT keep probing.

2. **Duplicate-target test.** Is your next planned tool call essentially the
   same as something already in your trace? Same URL + same method + same
   payload class (introspection / GET param fuzz / directory fuzz / known-path
   probe) counts as duplicate even if flags differ slightly. If yes — DO NOT
   re-run it. Pivot to a different surface or complete.

3. **Negative-result test.** Did a previous probe return a known-negative
   result (404 catch-all, identical baseline timing, generic 200 with no
   reflection / no error / no signal)? Do not retry the same probe with a
   minor flag tweak. Emit a `cleared_endpoint` finding so siblings know it's
   dead, then pivot or complete.

4. **Findings-emission rule.** When you complete, EVERY distinct discovery in
   your trace MUST appear as a `chain_findings` entry in `output_analysis`
   (e.g. one per service version, endpoint, technology, credential, cleared
   surface). Findings flow to siblings via chain context; `completion_reason`
   text is mostly discarded. A 0-finding completion is almost always wrong.

When you have completed your task or can go no further, emit action="complete" with a `completion_reason`.
Keep thought/reasoning concise. Prefer plan_tools when you can fire several independent tools at once.

## Previous Tool Output (MUST ANALYZE)

**Output**:

```

Emit chain_findings for EVERY notable signal in the output: new services,
confirmed vulns, credentials, exploit outcomes. One finding per distinct fact.
Do NOT hallucinate findings not in the output. Empty list is fine if the
output shows nothing security-relevant.

Set `exploit_succeeded = true` ONLY when output shows a Meterpreter session
opened, cracked credentials returned, or a command proved RCE (uid=0, file
read, etc.). When true, populate `exploit_details` with target_ip, cve_ids,
and evidence.

### Productivity Verdict (REQUIRED, used for loop detection)

Classify the output honestly:
  - `new_info`     — revealed something not already in your findings. Cite it in what_was_new.
  - `confirmation` — confirms an existing hypothesis without new facts (rare; never for repeats).
  - `no_progress`  — call succeeded but yielded no usable information.
  - `blocked`      — WAF / 401/403 / captcha / rate limit / auth wall.
  - `duplicate`    — output essentially identical to a recent call with similar args.

Marking 3+ repeated same-pattern calls as `confirmation` is dishonest and
auto-downgraded to `no_progress` by the orchestrator."""

Classify the WAVE as a whole:
  - `new_info`     — at least one tool revealed something not already known.
  - `confirmation` — wave confirmed existing hypothesis without new facts.
  - `no_progress`  — all tools succeeded but no usable information produced.
  - `blocked`      — wave hit WAF / 403 / captcha / rate limit / auth wall.
  - `duplicate`    — outputs essentially identical to a recent wave with similar args.

`confirmation` is dishonest after 3+ repeated same-pattern waves — the
orchestrator will auto-downgrade to `no_progress`."""
